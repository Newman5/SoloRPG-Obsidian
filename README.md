# SoloRPG – Obsidian Vault Support Tools

Welcome! This is an open project to create a set of tools and templates that make it easier—and more fun—to play a **Solo RPG with a unique rule set** using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

This vault is designed to be a companion for your solo adventures—offering automation, structure, and creative tools to help you focus on storytelling and exploration.

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Create a **template Obsidian vault** for solo RPG players to download, clone, and use immediately.
- Include support tools like:
  - 🎲 Dice rollers
  - 📊 Table lookups
  - 🗺️ Excalidraw integration for map drawing and journal visuals
- Build a clean, well-documented GitHub repository that can serve as:
  - A helpful resource for solo roleplayers
  - A model for documenting open-source or community RPG projects

---

## ✨ Features (Work in Progress)

- Turn log templates with frontmatter
- Automated stamina and resource tracking (via plugin snippets)
- Dice macros for 1d6, 1d10, playing cards, and event draws
- Excalidraw map tokens and styles for hex maps
- Folder structure for journaling, characters, and worldbuilding
- Guides for setup and use of required Obsidian plugins

---

## 📸 Future Ideas

- A **YouTube playthrough or demo video** showing how to use the vault  
- A lightweight **documentation site** explaining how it works
- Community-submitted expansions, tools, and plugins
- Possible interoperability with a web-based hex map generator (TBD)
