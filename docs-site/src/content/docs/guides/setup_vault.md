# 🛠️ Setup Guide: SoloRPG Vault in Obsidian

Welcome, adventurer! Follow these steps to install and customize your SoloRPG vault and start your first journey.

## 1. Get the Vault

For now, I'm not sharing the vault publically.  If you really want it sooner, you can ask via an issue or message. 

## 2. Open in Obsidian

- Open Obsidian
- Use “Open Folder as Vault” to select the folder
- Rename your vault if desired

## 3. Recommended Plugins

Consider these plugins via **Community Plugins**:
