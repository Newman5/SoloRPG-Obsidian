# Playing Alone, Building Together: Solo RPGs, Obsidian, and a Community Toolkit

Hey friend ðŸ‘‹

I've been working on a side project that combines three things I love: storytelling, tools for thought, and open-source collaboration. Itâ€™s all centered around **solo role-playing games (SoloRPGs)**â€”where you tell a story, roll some dice, and explore a world on your own terms.

But I didn't want to just play. I wanted to **build** something to make playing easier, more immersive, and maybe even shareable.

## So, what's the project?

I'm creating a **template vault in Obsidian** for playing SoloRPGsâ€”specifically for a system I've been exploring that uses unique maps, journal entries, turn tracking, and resource management. Think: exploration logs, maps drawn in Excalidraw, dice macros, card decks, and structured journaling.

The idea is: if you're playing a SoloRPG and want a digital assistant that *stays out of your way but helps you stay organized,* this vault is for you.

## Why Obsidian?

Obsidian is perfect for this because:

- It's markdown-based and local-first
- You can link your journal entries, character sheets, and maps easily
- Plugins like dice rollers and Excalidraw make it customizable and visual

Basically, it turns your solo campaign into an interconnected web of meaning. Like a personal wiki for your adventure.

## Why now?

Because I noticed something: every time I found a cool plugin or mapped out a system, I wrote it downâ€¦ somewhere. A notepad. A doc. A Discord message. Then I had to rewrite it to share it. Thatâ€™s inefficient.

So instead, I'm **building the docs and the vault in one place**â€”a public GitHub repo with an Astro-powered documentation site. That way, every time I discover something useful, I just drop it into the real thing. No extra steps.

## Whatâ€™s next?

- Finish the starter vault (templates, examples, plugin setups)
- Build out the docs with setup guides and ideas
- Maybe record a video playthrough (or convince someone better at narration to do it ðŸ˜…)
- Invite others to use it, improve it, remix it

## Want to follow along?

The site is live (early version!), and the GitHub repo is open. Whether you're into solo gaming, digital note-taking, or just curious how tools and stories intersectâ€”Iâ€™d love to have you along for the ride.

> Because even when we play solo, we can still build together.
