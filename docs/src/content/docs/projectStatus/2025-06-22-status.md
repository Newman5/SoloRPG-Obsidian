# 🧭 Project Backlog and Planning

This document tracks current progress, upcoming tasks, and ideas for future improvements. Updated as of RPG Day 2025!

---

## ✅ What’s Done

### 🔧 Technical Setup
- Astro + Starlight documentation site created
- GitHub repo initialized
- Obsidian vault started with journal and template structure

### 🌐 Web-based Map
- Created hex map generation system:
  - `generate-hexmap.cjs`: builds hex data
  - `hexmap.json`: holds map state
  - `index.html`: renders using D3 and `d3-hexbin`
- Matches Glide RPG’s hex layout

### 📝 Documentation & Logs
- `Update_0.md`: project introduction
- `Update_1.md`: map generation log and design notes

---

## 🚧 This Weekend’s Focus

- [ ] Choose strategy to link Obsidian notes to hexes
- [ ] Add unique metadata (e.g. hex ID or title) in `hexmap.json`
- [ ] Enable linking from rendered hex viewer to vault notes

---

## 🗂 General Backlog

### Obsidian Vault
- [ ] Finalize starter vault with:
  - Templates for turns, characters, resources
  - Pre-configured plugins (DiceRoller, Excalidraw)
- [ ] Add example campaign journal
- [ ] Build a stat tracker (manual or Dataview-driven)

### Docs Site
- [ ] Add `/guides/setup.md` walkthrough
- [ ] Add visual examples of vault structure
- [ ] Create components (e.g. alert boxes, how-to tables)

### Map & Game Integration
- [ ] Link map viewer to Obsidian content
- [ ] Enable read/write sync between hexmap and vault
- [ ] Design Excalidraw terrain/icon token system

---

## 🎥 Later Plans

- [ ] Record a walkthrough of a full Glide turn
- [ ] Annotate the vault with “how to play” tips
- [ ] Invite others to test and remix the vault
- [ ] Consider video/stream series or play-along blog
